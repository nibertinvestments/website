## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our website development repository seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure Process

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at [security@nibertinvestments.com](mailto:security@nibertinvestments.com)
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and address the issue:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Location of the vulnerability** (specific files, URLs, or code sections)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** (what an attacker could achieve)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with our assessment
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on complexity, but typically within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it
- Once the issue is resolved, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)
- We may ask you to test our fix before we deploy it

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this repository, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

#### Secrets Management
- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Rotate credentials** regularly
- **Use secure secret management** services in production

#### Dependencies
- **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Audit dependencies** regularly using security scanning tools
- **Use lock files** to ensure consistent dependency versions
- **Review third-party packages** before including them

### For Users

#### Environment Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all communications
- **Keep systems updated** with latest security patches
- **Use strong passwords** and enable two-factor authentication
- **Limit access permissions** to production environments

#### Development Security
- **Secure development environment** with proper access controls
- **Use VPN** when accessing sensitive systems
- **Enable firewall** and security software
- **Regular security training** for team members

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization flaws
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure

- Information leakage
- Missing security headers

## Security Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules, Bandit (Python), PHPStan
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Safety (Python), Composer audit
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair
- **SAST/DAST**: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP
- **Secret Scanning**: GitGuardian, TruffleHog

### CI/CD Security
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions security workflow
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Run dependency audit
        run: npm audit
